## TODO

### model
- total duration seems to not be correct in some real weeks
- report: top 3 weeks based on volume and duration
- report: (bar or pie) weekly volume in cohorts (0-10 ... 160-180) as percentage 
- implement 'average duration'
- implement filter by Period
- report: km per shoes

### UI
- implement two date fields for period filter
- implement filter for weeks above 100 km
- experiment with a pie chart (for shoes?)

- look at GraphQL
- how are lenses useful in this app?
- are there other json query like utils?
- look at Luxon versus Moment
